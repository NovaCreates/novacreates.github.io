  <h2>What Makes Look Stand Out</h2>
  <p>
    If you’re into cycling, you’ve probably heard of Look Cycle. They were the first to make clipless pedals (it’s way easier to ride with them!) and their carbon frames are super light and fast. Look bikes have been in everything from the Tour de France to your favorite local race. I think it’s cool how their bikes always look modern and colorful too.

  <h2>A Bit of Look History</h2>
  <p>
    Did you know Look was founded in France in the 1950s? Since then, they keep coming up with new ideas for cyclists—like those famous Keo pedals in the photo above. I like how they combine tradition with high-tech features.
